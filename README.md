# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
I achieved this through four steps:
1. I installed Node and Express packages and set up my Server.JS file.
2. Wrote GET Routes and POST routes to acquire data for the app
3. Acquired API Key and BaseURL from the OpenWeatherMap website to fetch weather stats using Async Functions.
4. Dynamically updating the UI to post current data for the user
*This project consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Express
